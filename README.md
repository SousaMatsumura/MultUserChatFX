# MultUserChatFX
Chat application presented as a partial requirement for approval in the discipline of Programming Language II, taught by professors Eduardo Pereira de Sousa and Ederson Rafael Wagner.
Credits for my professors and to the youtube channels JimOnDemand and Andres Jesse, with the playlists "Java Network Programming - Multi-User Chat Application" and "Creating an Application with JavaFX and SQLite", that I took as a reference to develop this little application.
